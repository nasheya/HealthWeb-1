### Instructions on how to set up this app and run it locally in your browser: 

Note that this will code is meant for a Mac/Unix environment. If you have Windows, you'll have to download the Node.js msi file from the node website. Here are step by step instructions:

*Note:* If you have Windows, you'll have to use Git Bash to do the following!

* You'll need to head over to the Node.js web page to install the node package. With this you'll get npm (the package manager that we will use to install dependencies for our app) to get our app running. [Visit the nodejs download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the instructions depending on which OS you have.

* Once you have that installed, navigate to the directory where you have cloned a copy of this repo and use the following commands:

```
npm install 
npm start
```

* The node app will then run locally on your computer. If you see the following (with a different directory based on where you've placed your files, the app has booted up properly).

```
> HealthWeb@0.0.0 start /Users/shivtoolsidass/Desktop/Tutorials/HealthWeb
> node ./bin/www

```


 To head to the port that the app runs on, type the following into your web browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

* Please make all of your changes in separate branches and do not commit to the master branch (I've made this mistake countless times and it is a pain to refactor code). To figure out how to branch, use this [git tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). 

* Feel free to reach out with questions!
